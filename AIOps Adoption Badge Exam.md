> What is a best practice to implement when preparing to implement an AIOps solution?
* Choose an AIOps solution that delays data ingestion until after deployment is complete
* Select a solution that limits data sources to reduce system complexity
* Focus on tools that operate independently without integrating with existing systems
* `Look for one with pre-built integrations and open APIs`

> Which of the following technologies is unique to Edwin AI and not part of the traditional AI in LM Envision?
* Forecasting
* `AI Agent`
* Dynamic thresholds
* Anomaly detection

> How does the AI in LM Envision learn to classify or make predictions?
* `The AI in LM Envision learns by referencing labelled historical data to then classify or make predictions`
* By randomly generating outputs and adjusting based on user reactions
* The AI in LM Envision learns by finding hidden patterns in unlabeled alert data
* The AI in LM Envision learns by storing all of your queries and having a conversation with you about the rationale behind the classifications

> What is the primary benefit of using Datapoint Analysis in LogicMonitor’s AIOps platform?
* It replaces all need for alert configuration
* It automatically resolves incidents across all resources
* It sends predictive alerts for future incidents
* `It reduces manual effort in diagnosing issues by identifying correlated metrics`

> A healthcare company wants to detect early signs of hardware degradation or service failure before patients are affected. Which AIOps capability will help them proactively resolve these issues?
* `Continuous anomaly detection through observability tools`
* Manual health checks by engineers
* Weekly log archiving
* Batch processing of help desk tickets

> What does it mean that Edwin AI includes generative AI capabilities?
* It requires scripts to be written for all automated tasks
* It stores and encrypts media files securely
* It manually tags reports for easier searching
* `It can generate narratives, insights, and recommendations based on data trends`

> Which of the following are true about LM Envision’s forecasting capabilities? (Select 3)
* It automatically sends alerts when a forecast predicts risk
* `It supports proactive resource planning and budgeting`
* `It uses statistical models based on historical data`
* `It can predict when a metric will cross an alert threshold`

> What is one of the major advantages of Edwin AI over traditional manual incident workflows?
* `Provides real-time insights, improves efficiency and drastically reduces alert volume and MTTR`
* Eliminates the need for any human intervention
* Focuses solely on data storage and backups
* Requires no documentation of IT Ops processes

> Jordan, a site reliability engineer, received a single incident ticket summarizing multiple related alerts during an outage. This streamlined the team’s troubleshooting by avoiding alert overload. Which feature of LogicMonitor’s Event Intelligence, powered by Edwin AI, made this streamlined alert experience possible?
* Re-ranking alerts based solely on CPU metrics
* Sending alerts directly to end users in real time
* `Reducing alert volume by clustering related alerts into one incident ticket`
* Automatically disabling low-priority alerts

> Why is unbalanced service detection especially important for AI workloads?
* `It helps evenly distribute compute-heavy tasks, avoiding performance slowdowns or unnecessary edits`
* It guarantees 100% uptime across all services
* It automates parameter tuning for machine learning models
* It ensures that the AI models are trained more quickly

> An IT leader is reviewing AIOps platforms to pair with Edwin AI. She wants to avoid vendor lock-in and ensure compatibility with her team's current tools. Which feature should be a top priority during the selection process?
* A closed-source platform with limited extensibility
* `Support for open APIs for integrations and open standards like MCP, A2A for AI Agents`
* A proprietary integration model limited to select vendor ecosystems
* A licensing model focused on bundled feature sets with minimal modularity

> What are some of the key outputs provided by the AI Agent to help users diagnose issues?
* Raw log exports only
* `AI-generated root cause analysis and actionable recommendations`
* Marketing data and customer surveys
* Static incident logs

> An IT Operations team wants to move beyond using static rules and reactive alerts by using AI that can understand intent, reason through complex conditions, and take action proactively. Which of the following would best support this approach?
* Discriminative AI
* Event correlation
* Rule-Based Alerting and Summarization
* `Agentic AI`

> Which of the following is an example of a qualitative benefit of AI in LM Envision?
* James uses LM Envision logs to monitor their infrastructure
* Sarah taking advantage of the automatic syncing of device configurations
* `Roger, a L1, using Log Analysis to make data-based decisions for recommendations to his manager`
* Janelle using the Cost Optimization feature to see where they can save on resources

> Paul is looking at how efficiently LogicMonitor is facilitating observability across their infrastructure. He notices that the platform integrates all of their data, structured and unstructured, provides real-time responses based on the data, and is eliminating data silos. Which part of an Agentic AIOps approach is this the result of?
* Telemetry analysis
* `Cross-domain observability`
* Discriminative AI
* Autonomous decision-making
