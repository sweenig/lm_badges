> Which of the following best distinguishes dynamic thresholds from static thresholds in LogicMonitor?

* `Dynamic thresholds rely on historical data patterns, while static thresholds use fixed values to trigger alerts.`
* Both static and dynamic thresholds use machine learning to detect anomalies.
* Static thresholds are better at identifying deviations from normal behavior than dynamic thresholds.
* Static thresholds adjust automatically, while dynamic thresholds must be configured manually.

> Jamie wants to monitor InsightNova’s cloud infrastructure and ensure that the overall health of business services can be tracked, even if individual components change over time. Which two LM Envision features would best help Jamie achieve her goals?

* SysOIDs and Ping Checks
* `LM Cloud and Service Insight`
* ConfigSources and PropertySources
* Traces and Alerts

> Jamie wants to explore the devices and cloud resources being monitored by InsightNova’s Collectors. She opens the Resource Tree page. Which two main panels make up the Resource Tree interface?

* Resource Map and Performance Graph
* `Navigation Panel and Detail Panel`
* Collector List and Device Metrics Chart
* Summary View and Alert Log

> Which of the following is an accurate comparison between Dashboards and Reports?

* `Dashboards provide a real-time or historical view of data within your LM account. Reports provide a historical view of your infrastructure or your data over a specific time period.`
* Reports and Dashboards are both used for managing alerts and device configurations in LogicMonitor.
* Both Dashboards and Reports provide real-time visualizations; however, only Dashboards can be scheduled and emailed.
* Reports provide a real-time view of your environment’s status and are only used internally. Dashboards are shared externally.

> ACME has recently expanded its infrastructure to include both cloud-based services and on-prem servers. They need a tool that can provide unified visibility across this hybrid environment. How does LogicMonitor support ACME’s need for comprehensive visibility across different types of infrastructure?

* By focusing exclusively on application-level metrics
* `By offering full-stack visibility across on-prem, cloud, and hybrid environments`
* By monitoring only physical servers to simplify complexity
* By requiring a separate platform for cloud monitoring

> What is the rationale supporting the principle of least privilege?

* It ensures that all users have access to all resources at all times to prevent workflow interruptions.
* It allows administrators to monitor all activity by granting full access and tracking changes.
* `It limits user and system access rights to the minimum necessary, reducing the risk of accidental or malicious misuse.`
* It improves performance by disabling multi-factor authentication for privileged accounts.

> Your team can see their system health and now are trying to improve the quality of their alerts. Which phase does this scenario best represent?

* Proactive Observability
* `Reactive Monitoring`
* Agentic AIOps
* Basic Monitoring

> As businesses increasingly shift to more hybrid environments, why is it important to distinguish between IT Infrastructure Monitoring and Cloud Monitoring when designing an observability strategy?

* Cloud Monitoring only monitors the internet connection, while IT Infrastructure Monitoring monitors applications and databases.
* IT Infrastructure Monitoring is mostly reactive, whereas Cloud Monitoring eliminates the need for human involvement entirely through automation.
* `IT Infrastructure Monitoring focuses on stable, on-prem resources, while Cloud Monitoring tracks dynamic, scalable systems that often change automatically.`
* Cloud Monitoring tools are usually more limited than traditional IT Infrastructure Monitoring tools, making it harder to maintain uptime in cloud environments.

> What is a likely consequence of leaving all alert thresholds at their default settings without reviewing and tuning?

* More accurate business reports
* Fewer alerts for the operations team
* Improved system performance
* `Increased risk of alert noise or missed critical issues`

> Which of the following best compares and contrasts Mappings and Traces in LogicMonitor?

* Mappings and Traces are used interchangeably to display user activity logs across the system.
* `Mappings visualize how physical network devices are connected, while Traces focus on how a request moves through an application and provide performance insights.`
* Mappings show the flow of a request through your application, while Traces map out physical device connections like switches and routers.
* Mappings and Traces both visualize application metrics, but Traces are only used for network hardware.

> Which protocols does the LogicMonitor Collector use to communicate with devices and retrieve performance metrics and status information? (Select 4)

* `JDBC`
* `HTTP`
* `SNMP`
* `WMI`
* SMTP

> Which capability of AIOps most directly supports faster root cause analysis in a dynamic, microservices-based environment?

* Infrastructure-as-code templating
* Continuous integration pipelines
* `AI-driven correlation of anomalies across distributed services`
* Predictive autoscaling

> Which of the following factors affects how many devices a single Collector can monitor?

* Time zone and network topology
* `Number of metrics collected per device and server resource availability`
* The operating system of each device being monitored
* The number of users logged into LogicMonitor

> Lena’s team wants to catch customer experience issues before users encounter them, especially in critical workflows like account creation and checkout. Which type of monitoring should Lena use to simulate user behavior and test the full journey?

* APM
* `Synthetic transactions`
* Log monitoring
* Manual testing

> Why might you choose to use Resource Explorer over the Resource Tree?

* It allows editing of LogicModules.
* `It offers a graphic, color-coded health summary of all monitored resources.`
* It provides access to log settings.
* It displays cost savings recommendations.
